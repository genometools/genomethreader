Show GenomeThreader output files containing intermediate results and assemble
the contained spliced alignments to consensus spliced alignments.

-translationtable  set the codon translation table used for codon translation in

                   default: no
-gff3out           show output in GFF3 format
                   default: no
-md5ids            show MD5 fingerprints as sequence IDs
                   default: no
-o                 redirect output to specified file
                   default: undefined
-gzip              write gzip compressed output file
                   default: no
-bzip2             write bzip2 compressed output file
                   default: no
-force             force writing to output file
                   default: no
-gs2out            output in old GeneSeqer2 format
                   default: no
-minalignmentscore set the minimum alignment score for spliced alignments to be
                   included into the set of spliced alignments
                   default: 0.00
-maxalignmentscore set the maximum alignment score for spliced alignments to be
                   included into the set of spliced alignments
                   default: 1.00
-mincoverage       set the minimum coverage for spliced alignments to be
                   included into the set of spliced alignments
                   default: 0.00
-maxcoverage       set the maximum coverage for spliced alignments to be
                   included into the set of spliced alignments
                   default: 9999.99
-intermediate      stop after calculation of spliced alignments and output
                   results in reusable XML format. Do not process this output
                   yourself, use the ``normal'' XML output instead!
                   default: no
-help              display help for basic options and exit
-help+             display help for all options and exit
