This directory contains the binary distribution of GenomeThreader (gth).
All rights reserved. Do not distribute.

It contains the following directories

bin/    contains the binary files and shell scripts
data/   contains some example data
doc/    contains the manual

To be able to work with GenomeThreader include bin/ in your path
and set the following environment variables (also explained in the
manual in doc/), e.g.:

setenv $BSSMDIR         "${HOME}/gth/bin/bssm"

and

setenv $GTHDATADIR      "${HOME}/gth/bin/gthdata"

If you have problems with file locking via NFS (for example you get an error
message like this: cannot flock: No locks available), then you can disable file
locking by setting the environment variable GTHNOFLOCK to any value.

For example, GTHNOFLOCK=yes
